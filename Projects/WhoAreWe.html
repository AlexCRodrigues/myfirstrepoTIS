<p>We have been working on this automatic potato farm, so you don't starve during your stay in the Gulag. Oh... good luck in surviving in the Gulag, you will need it, and if you go to hard labor in Siberia especially during the Winter all I can say is good luck in surviving without your precious potatoes</p>
